5-Wow this place is a classic. I've been coming here since the 80's. The food isso nostalgic and the place is almost like a second home to me;1-Garbage. Servie was awful. Bill was wrong. Save your money, go anywhere else.;4-Miss Katie's Diner deserves praise for being a consistent, long-time family owned (some would call dive) diner that consistently delivers good meals at fair prices.;3-I probably won't be back. Our waitress was horrible but another waitress tried to make it better. Food was average.. nothing special!;2-I get the old diner feel is 'cool', but I think cleanliness is cooler! I sat at table for 4 and all the silverware and table toppings were nasty looking. On top of that their prices don't match with quality or portion sizes of their food.;1-Holy cow! This is the MOST DISGUSTING SLOP EVER! I can't even call it food. I am so disgusted I am requesting a refund. I wouldn't eat this crap if someone paid me!

3-Had a burrito and two rolls. It was fine, nothing special.  Kind of pricey for mediocre.  Would probably head somewhere else, unless I lived on campus, and then it'd be a godsend.;5-Great and plenty amount of food for a reasonable price;4-Great ramen, nigiri sushi is skimpy;5-Great place to eat with any budget!!!;5-The atmosphere and food are unique in their own way. This place differentiates itself from local competition by being a prominent provider of Japanese and Asian cuisine. For the price, you honestly can't go wrong. I'm a college student and my budget varies weekly, so I'm glad it has quality options and a range of menu items and prices. If you aren't sure what to get, I'd try their sushi burritos, they are a perfect combination of rice, seafood and greens and for some, you can definitely fill up!

3- All I got were chips and queso which was good. But the manager was very short with customers when they were ordering and not very nice to his employees.;1- Please close and open up as a Chipotle. Portions are small and flavorless, pulled pork was full of fat.;1- Crazy and awful experience here with the rudest workers... Stay far away from this location.;4- The food is always delicious!! Speedy production, too. I swear, my burrito weighed about as much as me! I ended up eating it for 3 different meals. I will definitely be going back.;5- After telling the employee of my avocado allergy he took special care to make sure my food was not contaminated with guacamole. Amazing service! Thank you!;2- Rude staff. He gave us very little protein. Our first time here and he was very impatient when answering questions. I understand that there's a long line, but that doesn't give you the right to treat your customers poorly.

4- A really cool seafood place with tons of outdoor seating on a beach and awesome cocktails. I've only been here by boat- they have a huge dock that is easy to get in by boat or kayak. I've only eaten here once, and it was good, if not super memorable.;2- Stopped here after work with a few coworkers for drinks before a business function at Poto.  We had a disappointing and somewhat bizarre visit. Parking lot was only plowed enough for 5 cars after the unseasonably late snow. Only about 8 people in the place and service was crazy slow at the bar from the first of 3 different bartenders we had during our 45 min visit.;3- Basic seafood place are the best three words I have to describe The Twisted Fisherman. If you're looking for frills- heck, if you're looking for something as simple as bread or rolls on the table- you're looking in the wrong place.;1- Probably the worst dining out experience.  The beer was not very cold and the lines definitely have a problem that tainted the beer.;3- When I read their menu online I was excited to try this place even though I'm not a seafood eater. I loved the decor of this place, the outside seating is a bit of a maze. Our waitress was slow with drinks and wasn't very attentive but nothing too bad in my opinion.  The food was ok. I wasn't impressed with my ribs, the bbq sauce lacked flavor but very meaty. The surf n turf my boyfriend had (snow crab and half rack of ribs) was skimpy at best but he said the crab was good. We both agreed the sauce needed more flavor. Two of our dinner companions had the steak which was really small and not cooked to their liking. I really wanted this place to knock our socks off but unfortunately it didn't!;5- Attended a wedding on 8/26, the food was spectacular, atmosphere was great and the service was above and beyond great! There was a steak, a chicken and a cheese tortellini dish to choose from....I had the steak and it was prepared perfect and able to be cut with a butter knife. I talked to others who had the other meals and they said they were outstanding! Great portions!
